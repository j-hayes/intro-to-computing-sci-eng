# Computer Computational Skills for Scientists and Engineering 
An introduction to programming for Scientists and Engineers with focus on Good Foundations, Clean Code, Mathematics, and Tools for Further Learning 

Important Best Practices will be in bold orange text 

<span style="color:#ff9c19; font-weight:bold">Every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. All of that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.[[1]](#1)</span>
