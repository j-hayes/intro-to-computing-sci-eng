# Opinions 

## Programming languages for this tutorial 
In general I prefer languages and frameworks that are "opinionated."  

### C / C++ 
C / C++ are used because they are de-facto standard languages for modern scientific programming and for learning programing concepts that are "close" to the hardware and high performance. 

### Julia
I have chosen julia as a general purpose language for this tutorial because of its ease of use, syntax, and scripting abilities. It is also has the best trade off I know of between out of the box mathematical / computational performance and ease of use. 

### C# 
I use C# becuase it is the language I have worked most frequently with. Also the tools, packages, documentation put out by Microsoft make it a great general purpose compiled language for learning and mastering for professional use. I will mostly use it in psuedo code examples because well when I think of code my mind thinks in C#. 

### Other languages 
Mathematica - to do the mathematical operations it is best at, because it is still best in class. 
Bash/Powershell/Batch - because standard scripting languages are hard to get around. 
Others, mostly just to see different concepts that can't be shown in the above languages or to give broad expoure.
