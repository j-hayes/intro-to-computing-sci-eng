# Module 1: Introduction and Computer Setup   


### Is it code or codes? 
Without starting an all out war, my short answer is I come from a non-academic world where everyone agrees that code is a "massive noun" meaning it has no plural. However, historically academic and mathematical writers have used the term codes to refer to the plural of code. We will use code because it sounds better and is grammatically correct. 

Examples: 
That code is broken.
I wrote some code today.
Wow that is some gross code. 
Wow that codebase is beautiful. 
My code is not compiling. 
That code should really be open-source.
