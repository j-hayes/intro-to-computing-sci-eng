# Module 1: Introduction and Computer Setup   

## Core concepts of the course  

#### Learn how to program, not how to program in a language  

#### How the code works is as important as that it works  

#### Learn how to learn and think like a programmer 

### Computational thinking: [[1]](#1) 

#### Decomposition
- breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller, more manageable parts 
#### Pattern recognition 
- looking for similarities among and within problems 
#### Abstraction
- focusing on the important information only, ignoring irrelevant detail 
#### Algorithms
- developing a step-by-step solution to the problem, or the rules to follow to solve the problem”

### Is it code or codes? 
Without starting an all out war, my short answer is I come from a non-academic world where everyone agrees that code is a "massive noun" meaning it has no plural. However, historically academic and mathematical writers have used the term codes to refer to the plural of code. We will use code because it sounds better and is grammatically correct. 

Examples: 
That code is broken.
I wrote some code today.
Wow that is some gross code. 
Wow that codebase is beautiful. 
My code is not compiling. 
That code should really be open-source. 

## We have it really easy in the 21st century: a very brief history of computing

## Command line basics (cmd/unix shell/powershell/etc.) 

Basic Commands:
Change Directory

```
cd ./theDirector

```

List Contents of Directory
Make a Directory 
Make a file
Delete a file
Remove a Directory 
Remove a directory and all its contents 
Execute a file 
Edit a file

```
cd 
```

Exercises 
- Navigating the file structure 
- Create a directory
- Creating a file 
- Deleting a file  
- Moving a file 
- Running a script  

## Computer Setup, Installing, and configuration
TODO

## Prep work for module 2: 

## Installing needed software 

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

In this tutorial we will be using Visual Studio Code to write and execute our code. 
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

More on IDEs later in the course [IDEs](/Modules/Module4/README.md)

### Windows subsystem for Linux (if on Windows)  
 
All program instructions for this course will assume you are on a UNIX based operating system (Linux, Mac). If you are using a windows computer you will need to install Windows Subsystem (WSL) for linux and learn how to connect to it through Visual Studio Code ssh tool. WSL allows you to easily install and use a linux virtual machine that can be used on a windows computer. 

Installing Windows Subsystem Linux
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

There are many video tutorials on how to do this as well. We will do this together in class if you are going tutorial in person. 

Installing the WSL extension for VSCode

### SDKs and Languages (Python, Julia, C++, etc.)  
In this tutorial we will use several different languages to get you familiar with them. We will install them all in this part of the tutorial to save us the headache of doing that as they come up 

## How to google like a programmer part 1  

Google your exact question and you will likely find something on stack overflow.  

## Thinking about functions 
### Excel: battle hardened software, so you don’t have to do the heavy lifting  

#### Excel functions  

#### Math functions

#### Goal Seek  

#### Manipulating strings data  

### Exercise 

Use Excel to solve math problem (goal seek) 

Use Excel to manipulate data 	 

Requirements Gather: What should the code do? 

## Asking the right questions up front build the code that is actually needed
